            <h2>Hello! I'm Sparrow.</h2>
            <p>
              I was a graphic designer for over 10 years. In early 2020, I began
              taking HTML and CSS courses on Free Code Camp. Later in the year,
              I attended a full stack-web development bootcamp where I learned
              Javascript, Nodejs, and React.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>I landed my first software development job in early 2021
              where I worked primarily with Java, Spring Boot, and Javascript.
              There I headed an Angularjs to React migration in an effort to
              eliminate tech debt.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>At the start of 2022, I began a fast track certification
              program with Cookâ€™s Systems in which I was able to solidify my
              skills in Java, Spring Boot, and React.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>A proud member BASE (Birmingham Area Software
              Enthusiasts), when I am not coding or learning how to code, I
              enjoy reading, exercising, and hanging out with my two cats.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>I am hireable, it's {hireable.toString()}.
